\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at the department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark in fulfilment of the requirements for acquiring an M.Sc. in Informatics.

The thesis deals with designing, implementing and testing a new method for robust record-level data extraction from web pages, given a single annotated page as a training set.

The thesis consists of three main parts: (1) the design of the algorithm, including state of the art method overview, (2) Java implementation of the design, and (3) an experiment, which tested performance and accuracy of the implementation with real world dataset.
