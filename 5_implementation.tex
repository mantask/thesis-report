\section{Tree Structures}

% requirements, alternatives, choices
For the most part of the wrapping process, the core data structure that is being manipulated is a labeled, ordered, rooted tree. The algorithms used require a small number of (mostly navigation) operations on trees. While there are certainly a great number of various graph libraries, most of them add extra level of complexity in terms of unnecessary operations and unused data stored. Thus, we decided to implement a light-weight tree data structure on our own.

% entities
There are three essential classes that represent a graph (see Figure~\ref{fig:package-tree}). The actual data is stored in a \texttt{Node}. A \texttt{Tree} organizes the \texttt{Node} objects into a hierarchical structure with a root node. A \texttt{Forest} combines a set of \texttt{Tree} objects to represent a disjoint union of trees. All classes are immutable, which allows for further data manipulation without the state management problems.

% behaviour for each entity

\paragraph{Node} As we primarily aim at wrapping HTML documents, we build a tree of three types of \texttt{Node} objects: an element, an attribute or a text. The class has a convenience factory methods for building a \texttt{Node} of each type.

\paragraph{Tree} The \texttt{Tree} class stores current root node and a pointer to each of its subtrees. The class enables to select different parts of the tree for many of its use cases: \texttt{children()}, \texttt{child()}, \texttt{tail()}, \texttt{prefix()}, \texttt{subforest()}, \texttt{subtree()}. Due to its hierarchical structure, the most of methods in the class are recursive. A tree comparison heuristics is implemented in \texttt{substantiallyDifferentFrom()} method, which compares the node count of two trees.

\paragraph{Forest} Some operations on trees, e.g. \texttt{tail()}, return a disjoint set of trees. These are grouped under a \texttt{Forest} class. It also adds convenience methods for manipulating the forest: \texttt{removeRightmostTree()} and \texttt{removeRightmostRoot()}. It is important to note that the data structure is immutable, and all edit operations return a new instance of a \texttt{Forest}. This helps to avoid state management.

\paragraph{TreeUtils} Tree structure comparison is extracted as an utility method in \texttt{TreeUtils} class. This approach was chosen over \texttt{equals()} method inside the \texttt{Tree} class, in order not to break a key inside key-value collections through \texttt{hashCode()} method.

\paragraph{PostOrderNavigator} \texttt{PostOrderNavigator} walks the tree in a post-order and returns a list of visited nodes.

\paragraph{RtedMapper} For tree edit-distance calculations we use RTED library from \cite{pawlik2011a}. The library uses a string representation of trees as input. Thus we use adapter \texttt{RtedMapper} to map our \texttt{Tree} object into the required string.

\section{Data Region Locator}

% requirements, alternatives, choices

\end{figure}

% entities
Data region locator logic is grouped in the \texttt{region} package (see Figure~\ref{fig:package-region}). \texttt{DataRegion} class contains the data record structure, while \texttt{DataRegionLocator} implements the Algorithm~\ref{alg:locating-data-region-containing-node} for locating data regions. \texttt{DiffsToNextGeneralizedNode} is data structure for convenient storage of tree edit-distances.

% behaviour for each entity

\paragraph{DataRegion} The \texttt{DataRegion} class contains a set of data records (i.e. \texttt{Forest} classes) and a position index from its parent node in a tree. The method \texttt{isCoveredBy()} checks whether two data regions overlap. The other methods are getters for accessing various pieces of data records.

\paragraph{DataRegionLocator} The \texttt{DataRegionLocator} logic is split across three private methods: \texttt{calcCombinations()}, \texttt{findDataRegions()}, and \texttt{identifyDataRecords()}. These basically implement the Algorithm~\ref{alg:locating-data-region-containing-node} directly. Yet there are a few custom heuristics and optimizations. First, we limit a number of nodes per data record to 3 to reduce the search space. Next, we limit edit-distance calculations for trees that are not substantially different. Finally, we use RTED library from \cite{pawlik2011a} to compute tree edit-distance instead of Levenshtein distance for string edit-distance.

\paragraph{DiffsToNextGeneralizedNode} The \texttt{DiffsToNextGeneralizedNode} is a convenience data structure for two dimensional array access.

\section{Change Model}

% requirements, alternatives, choices
This package (see Figure~\ref{fig:package-changemodel}) contains the probabilistic transducer \emph{TP} and a change model from Algorithm~\ref{alg:prob-record-level-wrapper} described by Dalvi et al. \cite{dalvi2009a}. The implementation follows a recursive algorithm nature as defined by Dalvi. 

We don't learn a probabilistic model of change from web page archive. We assume it is provided. We consider that having a universal HTML change model is in line with Dalvi et al. \cite{dalvi2009a} findings, that models learned on two different datasets were quite similar without major differences.

\end{figure}

% entities
The core logic is in the \texttt{ProbabilisticTransducer} class. The probabilities of HTML tag modification is stored in a \texttt{ProbabilisticChangeModel} data structure. \texttt{TransformationProbabilities} class acts as a cache to store transformation probabilities for trees. \texttt{NumberUtils} is a helper class for floating point calculations.

% behaviour for each entity

\paragraph{ProbabilisticChangeModel} The class \texttt{ProbabilisticChangeModel} is a data structure for storing insert, delete and substitute probabilities of various HTML tags. It contains getters and setters for probabilities. The method \texttt{valid()} checks, if sum of all probabilities is $1.0$ and other rules hold. This is helpful for validating data input, as change models are loaded but not learned by our implementation.

\paragraph{TransformationProbabilities} After calculating the chance of one tree being transformed into another tree, we store the probability in a cache, i.e. \texttt{TransformationProbabilities} class. This class acts as an in-memory key-value storage. By caching the probabilities, we reduce the amount of calculation in recursive $TP$ calls in Algorithm~\ref{alg:prob-record-level-wrapper}.

\paragraph{ProbabilisticTransducer} The class \texttt{ProbabilisticTransducer} calculates a probability of transforming original tree into transformed one in \texttt{prob()} method. The method is provided with a number of convenience interfaces. The implementation adds a performance optimization for substantially different trees and a caching strategy for repeat tree comparison.

The class also provides a random process \texttt{transform()}, that makes one pass over the whole forest and at each position, it randomly decides to either delete a node, change its label, or insert new nodes.

\paragraph{NumberUtils} As probabilities are stored in a floating point numbers, the use of class \texttt{NumberUtils} ensures 6 digit decimal point precision.

\section{Probabilistic Wrappers}

% requirements, alternatives, choices
The core data wrapping functionality is provided in this package. The wrappers are first initialized with initial tree and can be used to wrap transformed trees multiple times.

\end{figure}

% entities
The class \texttt{ProbabilisticPageLevelWrapper} finds the single most probable candidate node in a transformed tree and the class \texttt{ProbabilisticRecordLevelWrapper} performs the same action for multiple data records.

% behaviour for each entity

\paragraph{ProbabilisticPageLevelWrapper} The class \texttt{ProbabilisticPageLevelWrapper} initializes with an initial tree, distinguished node and a change model. Later it can wrap multiple transformed trees. The method \texttt{wrap()} iterations through candidate nodes and returns the most probable one. It's a direct implementation of Algorithm~\ref{alg:optimal-probabilistic-wrapper}.

\paragraph{ProbabilisticRecordLevelWrapper} The class \texttt{ProbabilisticRecordLevelWrapper} implements the Algorithm~\ref{alg:prob-record-level-wrapper}. As \texttt{ProbabilisticPageLevelWrapper}, this class is first initialized with initial tree and a distinguished node, and later can wrap transformed trees multiple times.

\section{HTML Document Parser}

% requirements, alternatives, choices
Our wrapper uses internal tree data structures. In order for the implementation to be used as a component in other projects, we provide an HTML adapter (see Figure~\ref{fig:package-html}). This adapter converts HTML document string into our tree data structure and loads probabilistic change model from an external file.

% entities
\texttt{HtmlTreeFactory} builds a tree structure from Java DOM model. \texttt{ProbabilisticChangeModelFactory} loads probabilities from a comma separated file into \texttt{ChangeModel} class. The actual web wrapping is performed by \texttt{HtmlRecordWrapper}.

% behaviour for each entity

\paragraph{HtmlRecordWrapper} The class \texttt{HtmlRecordWrapper} parses HTML document string into DOM with the help of JSoup library. This library tidies HTML and parses into a clean tree. The class accepts CSS selector for identifying a distinguished node. Next, DOM is mapped to internal tree structures and the wrapping is performed.

\paragraph{ProbabilisticChangeModelFactory} The class \texttt{ProbabilisticChangeModelFactory} reads a comma separated file into memory.

\paragraph{HtmlTreeFactory} The class \texttt{HtmlTreeFactory} maps DOM tree node by node into local tree data structure. Only element and text nodes are mapped, ignoring attributes, comments, CDATA, etc. nodes.
