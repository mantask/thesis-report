\chapter{Summary}

The World Wide Web organizes information in HTML documents, which hold semi-structured data. For a server generated document from a template, information schema can be implied, and structured data extraction can be automated with queries, i.e. (web) wrappers. When user interface gets updated, the document structure changes, and wrapper has a tendency to break. Extracting multiple data records in a robust way from a single web page is the subject of this project. Current state of the art methods allow to detect template-based data regions on the page, to extract data from a single region in a robust way, and repeatedly extract data from multiple regions. In this thesis, we combine the three ideas into a new method for building a robust record-level wrapper from a single user-annotated web page. We design and implement the algorithm and compare it with existing tools. Experimental results using a large number of web pages from multiple domains show that the proposed approach works with a high precision and within reasonable execution time on commodity hardware.
