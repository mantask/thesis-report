\chapter{Summary}

The web contains semi-structured information in HTML, i.e. tree structure. To extract semantic data from a web page, which gets updated, a non-breaking algorithm is required. Building the most robust wrapper is the subject of this project. Current state of the art proposes robust web extraction framework that uses archival data and training examples to build the wrapper. We constrain our problem by having a single base version of a web page, a single training example and limited execution time. Building on the framework, I would carry out an empirical research and experiment with variations: (1) precompute various minimum cost models, (2) try $O(n)$ heuristics for calculating min diff between two trees vs $O(n^3)$ traditional approach, (3) try different candidate wrapper generation techniques.
